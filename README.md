## Introduction
This repository hosts implementations of multiple machine learning projects:
- Linear Regression with synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Cross-Validation techniques to optimize models.
- Lasso and Ridge regression for regularization.
- Classification metrics and confusion matrix.

## Installation
To run the projects in this repository, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Regression
The regression project demonstrates the use of linear regression for both synthetic and real-world datasets. Key highlights include:

- **Synthetic Data**: A simple example using a generated dataset to illustrate the basic steps of machine learning: model creation, fitting, and prediction.
- **Boston Housing Data**: Utilization of the Boston housing dataset to predict house prices based on various features. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implementation of K-Fold cross-validation to optimize model performance.
- **Lasso and Ridge Regression**: Exploration of regularization techniques to handle overfitting and improve model generalization.

## Classification
The classification project focuses on the application of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for binary classification. Key highlights include:

- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Using the breast cancer dataset to classify malignant and benign tumors. The project covers data splitting, model training, and evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualization of model performance using a confusion matrix to understand the classification results.
- **Classification Report**: Detailed classification report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
